12.	Customer Data Privacy.
i)       Remote Data Storage – Eclipse Market Solutions affirms that customer instant messages are the property of the customer, and affirms that it does not store or monitor customer instant messaging data on its servers. Any record of an instant message passing through the Point Box system is immediately and permanently destroyed upon delivery of that message. In the case that a Point Box Instant Message could not be delivered it will be purged from the system’s buffer by an automated database cleaning routine. Point Box does not buffer undeliverable instant messages sent by third party messaging systems (AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger, etc.).
ii)       Local Data Storage – The Point Box Console application creates records of instant messages conversation on the customer’s local computer or network for the customer’s use. These records are the sole property of the customer, and are in no way retrievable by Eclipse. These records may be accessed or destroyed by the customer at any time.
